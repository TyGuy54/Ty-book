# Getting Started with Create React App and Tauri

### `npm run tauri dev`

runs both the webapp and desktop windows. 

### `npm run tauri build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
